# Introduction to project

In the era of digital music, the rise of online music streaming platforms has brought significant changes to the music industry, including the way music is consumed, produced, and reviewed. As a result, large amounts of data are now available for analysis, offering valuable insights into the preferences, behaviors, and opinions of music listeners. In this project we aim to take the subset of Vinyl records from the dataset and analyse the reviews for the products to uncover the genre of music the reviews are based on. This was done because vinyl records are a relatively old medium, and there was an interest in looking at how people percieve the medium of vinyl in today's world. 


<!--This is done by splitting the reviewers into different communities and then analyzing the text of the reviews, looking at the most common phrases/patterns in the reviews. Finally, there will be made a guess of the genre of the music the different communities are based on.

## Math formula


$$ x^n + y^n = z^n $$

## Code chunk


```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame()
```
will make a code snippet with a dedicated codebox for this piece of code
