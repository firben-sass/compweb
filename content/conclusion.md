In conclusion, this project aimed to analyze the social network constructed using a subset of vinyl records from Amazon Review Data (2018) and analyze the reviews for the products to uncover the genre of music the reviews are based on. Through various analyses such as degree analysis, assortativity, centrality analysis, we were able to uncover insights into the structure and clustering of the network, as well as the relationships between different genres of music based on the reviews.
